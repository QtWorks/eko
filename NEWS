   Hi.
   First of all, this release fixes all bugs those I knew. It includes the multilply (> 2) channels processing, fading, selections and many more.
   The "Normalize" function now takes the parameter in dB.
   Now you can monitor the input signal (Tune - Sound devices - Monitor input option).
   The volume can be adjusted dynamically using the volume (or dynamics) automation envelope and "Functions - Dynamics" menu.

   With the 4.0.0 I'm afraid (yes) to introduce the initial Win32 build that I didn't test much.

   Stay tuned.
