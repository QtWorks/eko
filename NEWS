   Hello! The fifth EKO's code has been heavy rewritten to share the codebase with my new project, the minimalistic DAW - Wavylon. Also there are many errors were fixed, and limitations eliminated. But what is changed for the user?
   EKO becomes more stable. Some new realtime FX - two guitar pedals emulators, the filter and the delay module. But they are will be more useful with Wavylon. 
   So there is not so much visible and audible changes but the inner changes allows me to move EKO forward. 
   

   Stay tuned.
